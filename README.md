# Hospicare--Django-project
In emergencies, every second counts, and having real-time access to hospital bed availability can be the difference between life and death. This tool ensures critical time is saved, helping patients get the care they need without delay.

Hospicare is a real-time platform developed during a hackathon to address the challenge of locating hospital beds in emergencies.It shows real-time updates on available hospital beds and on-duty doctors in hospitals in your city or area. With an easy-to-use search feature users can find the nearest hospital that fits their needs. Whether itâ€™s for affordability, proximity, or specific medical care, this platform makes the stressful process of finding a hospital bed much simpler and faster, potentially saving lives when every second counts.
